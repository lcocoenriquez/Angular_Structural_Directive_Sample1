# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a custom structural directive in Angular. The directive, named `select`, is used to load data from a `DataSource` and render a template with the loaded data.

## Style and Design

The application has a minimalist design, focusing on the functionality of the structural directive. The main view consists of a single paragraph that displays the data loaded by the directive.

## Features

- **Custom Structural Directive:** The core feature is the `*select` structural directive.
- **Asynchronous Data Loading:** The directive loads data asynchronously from a `DataSource`.
- **Dynamic Template Rendering:** The directive renders an embedded view with the loaded data.

## Project Structure

- The project has been streamlined to remove unused files and configurations. The routing module and related files have been deleted, resulting in a more focused and efficient application structure.
